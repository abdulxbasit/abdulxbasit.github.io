            <blockquote>“The best time to water your plants is when the soil is dry to the touch, but before the plant shows signs of distress.”</blockquote>

            <h2>3. Provide Sufficient Light</h2>
            <p>Different plants require varying amounts of light. Some thrive in direct sunlight, while others prefer low-light conditions. Understanding these needs is key to plant health.</p>

            <h2>4. Fertilize Regularly</h2>
            <p>Regular fertilization is important for the growth of your plants. Use a balanced fertilizer and follow the instructions for the best results.</p>
